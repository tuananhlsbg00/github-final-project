## About the Project

The Simple Interest Calculator allows users to calculate the interest accrued over a given period based on three inputs:
- **Principal amount (p)**: The initial sum of money placed or borrowed.
- **Time period (t)**: The duration (in years) for which the interest is calculated.
- **Rate of Interest (r)**: The annual rate of interest, given as a percentage.

### Formula
The formula used to calculate simple interest is:

   simple interest = p * t * r
